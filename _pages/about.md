I am **Alía Warsco** (she/her/ella), a Brooklyn-based librarian focused on critical librarianship, digital scholarship, and digital access and preservation. I completed my MSLIS from Long Island University in December 2024 and my MA in Latin American and Caribbean studies from NYU in May 2025.

My practice is informed by methods of Indigenous and critical librarianship, and my research centers on Indigenous language use in Latin America as a form of resistance and identify formation. I learned Runasimi (Quechua, Cusco Variety) during my time at NYU. I am the digital librarian and creator of [Runakunaq Bibliotecanku](https://runaqlib.github.io/runakunaqbibliotecanku/), a collection of resources that center the Andes and Quechua language.

I interrogate how—and indeed whether—digital libraries and archives can be employed for Indigenous language documentation and learning. My thesis for NYU involved digitizing, transcribing, and translating [_Cronicawan_](https://runaqlib.github.io/cronicawan-wax/), a state-supported Quechua newspaper published in 1975 in Peru. I am also a member of the [Runasimi Outreach Collective](https://www.instagram.com/roc_nyu/) at NYU.

Outside of my academic interests, I also love stick-and-poke tattoos and my dog, Rudy.
