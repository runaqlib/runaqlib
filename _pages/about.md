I am **Alía Warsco** (she/her/ella), a Brooklyn-based dual-degree student in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University, and Library and Information Science at Long Island University. My projected graduation date is December 2024.

My work is largely influenced by methods of Indigenous and critical librarianship. Most of my research is in Indigenous language use in Latin America as forms of state resistance and identity formation. I am learning Runasimi (Quechua, Cusco Variety) at NYU. I am also the digital librarian and creator of [Runakunaq Bibliotecanku](https://runaqlib.hosting.nyu.edu), a collection of resources that center the Andes, Quechua language, and worldwide Indigenous learning.


I am interrogating how—and indeed whether—digital libraries and archives can be employed for Indigenous language documentation and learning. My thesis is tentatively named _Language as an Everyday Form of Resistance: The Case of Southern Quechua_. I am also a member of the [Runasimi Outreach Collective](https://www.instagram.com/roc_nyu/) at NYU.

Outside of my academic interests, I also do stick-and-poke tattoos and love my dog, Rudy.
